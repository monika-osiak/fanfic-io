# fanfic.io - open-source repository for fanworks
Simple [Archive Of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org/) clone created with Django
and SQLite.

## General info
Archive of Our Own (AO3) is **a nonprofit open source repository for fanfiction and 
other fanworks contributed by users**. Its development is sponsored and managed by
the Organization for Transformative Works, a nonprofit organization by and for fans.

Originally it is written in Ruby on Rails but I want to master my Django skills...
So I decided to make something similar using Django.

## Technologies
This project is created with:
* Python 3.7.1
* Django 2.1.4

## Features
With an fanfic.io, you can:
* public your stories
* make character pages so your readers can get to know OC (original characters) better
* write drafts stories (unposted ones)
* comment other stories
* collect bookmarks - stories you particularly like and want to follow
* give some kudos - when you need to reward a chapter for its brilliance

Some of the features are still under development.

## Additional info: what the hell is *fanfiction*?
via [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fanfiction)
> Fanfiction is when someone takes either the story or characters (or both) of a
certain piece of work, whether it be a novel, tv show, movie, etc, and create their
own story based on it. Sometimes people will take characters from one movie and put
them in another, which is called a cross-over.

So basically it is fiction about character (or settings) from and original work of
fiction created by fans of that work.
